# YouTube Comment Sentiment Classification
This project uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Logistic Regression to classify YouTube comments into three sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.

# Dataset
Kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atifaliak/youtube-comments-dataset

# Key Features
1. Converts text data into numerical representation using TF-IDF Vectorizer
2. Trains a Logistic Regression model for sentiment classification
3. Achieves efficient and interpretable results for text-based sentiment analysis
4. Can be extended to other comment-based platforms

# How It Works
1. Preprocess the YouTube comments (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).
2. Convert text into numerical features using TfidfVectorizer.
3. Train a Logistic Regression model on labeled sentiment data.
4. Predict sentiment categories (Positive, Negative, Neutral) for new comments.
