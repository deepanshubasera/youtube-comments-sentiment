Kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atifaliak/youtube-comments-dataset

ðŸ”¹ Key Features
âœ… Converts text data into numerical representation using TF-IDF Vectorizer
âœ… Trains a Logistic Regression model for sentiment classification
âœ… Achieves efficient and interpretable results for text-based sentiment analysis
âœ… Can be extended to other comment-based platforms

ðŸš€ How It Works
1.Preprocess the YouTube comments (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).
2.Convert text into numerical features using TfidfVectorizer.
3.Train a Logistic Regression model on labeled sentiment data.
4.Predict sentiment categories (Positive, Negative, Neutral) for new comments.
